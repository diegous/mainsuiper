# Mainsuiper

Minesweeper implementation with a Rails API backend and vanilla JS single page application.

You can try it out [here](http://mainsuiper.herokuapp.com/)

## To Do
- Separate frontend from rails
- Add user registration
- Add page history tracking (back forward browser buttons don't work)
- Add tests
- Change backend and frontend routes. They are quite ugly.
