# Mainsuiper

Minesweeper implementation with a Rails API backend and vanilla JS single page application.

## To Do
- Separate frontend from rails
- Refactor Game class, extract logic to a handler or something
- Add user registration
- Add page history tracking (back forward browser buttons don't work)
- Add tests
